# JS-War-CardGame
A remake of the classic card game "War" where the Card with the Highest value (number value) wins.
If the value is a face value (King, Queen, Jack, Ace) the value is based according to:

Lowest to Highest:
Jack: 11
Queen: 12
King: 13
Ace: 14

If both cards have the same value, then the deal breaker is their suit value:

Lowest to highest:
Spades: 1
Clover: 2
Hearts: 3
Diamonds: 4
